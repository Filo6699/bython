# Bython

The best language for competitive programming.

## Description

Bython is interpreted language and its written in C++.

The interpretator is in 1 file with the code, so its basically C++, but better.

## Features

Many features are absent, it is intended. For example, multiplication was a feature, but deleted in a newer update.

- [x] int
- [x] float
- [ ] string
- [ ] bool
- [ ] double
- [ ] else
- [ ] loops
- [ ] functions
- [x] procedures
- [ ] < <= == >=
- [x] >
- [x] Addition
- [x] Substruction
- [ ] Multiplication
- [ ] Division
- [x] Bitshift to right (only int)
- [ ] Bitshift to left
- [x] Supports trans rights

## Example

```
string code =
    "print Hello, world!;"
;
```

## Advanced usage

You can write Bython in .by files.
Use [bython-bint](https://github.com/Filo6699/bython-bint) for syntax highlighting.
Compile and use bundle.cpp to make a .cpp file with everything. (and upload to contester) 

Command that i use:
```shell
./bundle a+b.by out.cpp && g++ out.cpp && ./a.out && rm out.cpp && rm a.out
```
